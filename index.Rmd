# Background on the Opioid Crisis in America

The United States opioid epidemic is a nationwide public health crisis. Initially driven by increased consumption and availability of pharmaceutical opioids such as oxycontin, an increasing number of opioid overdoses are now related to heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Deaths related to opioid use have sharply increased from 1996 when advertisement around opioid based pharmaceuticals became unrestricted.

# Research Questions

I wanted to look at the steady increase in opioid-related deaths in the US from 1990 to 2019 with the advent of unrestricted pharmaceutical marketing and deployment . I wanted to plot the data spatially by looking at how opioid related deaths have differed across different US states. However, I wanted to keep the temporal aspect of the data, so therefore I made a data file for every year with every states opioid-related death rate. This allowed the data to be visualized in two separate but congruent ways.

## Data Source

All the data was sourced from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

## Data Wrangling

First the data needed to be cleaned, this meant deleting unnecessary columns from the data file and merging items together. Each year was separated into its own distinct data file. I also tested one of the individual years and merged it into a map of mainland america to show how the visualisation would be peiced togehter.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# read and open data
## save data file as df

df <- read.csv(here('rateofdeath.csv'))


#deleting unnessecary columns

columns_to_delete <- c("measure_id", "measure_name","cause_id", "metric_id","cause_name","metric_name","age_id","sex_id","sex_name","age_name","upper","lower")
df <- df[, !(names(df) %in% columns_to_delete)]


#renaming collumns

##location_name change to state
colnames(df)[colnames(df) == "location_name"] <- "state"

##val change to number_deaths 
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="val"] <-"death_rate"

# Function to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string
capitalize_state <- function(state_name) {
  str_to_title(state_name)  # Capitalize each word in the string
}

# Capitalize state names in the dataframe
df$state <- sapply(df$state, capitalize_state)

# Making maps for each year

To make my next plot of a gif I needed to make a plot for each year that didn't change scales according to the specific death rate of that year. The scale was made constant and each figure saved into a separate file called 'figures'.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#make a loop for all death maps 1990-2019
#keep death rate scale constant through all years to show true change in death rate

##
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming 'figures' is the name of your directory for saving plots
figures <- "figures"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
if (!file.exists(figures)) {
  dir.create(figures)
}

# Function to generate and save map for a specific year
generate_and_save_map <- function(current_year) {
  # Filter data for the current year
  current_data <- df %>% filter(year == current_year)
  
  # Left join with map data
  map_data <- left_join(current_data, us_states, by = "state")
  
  # Calculate overall scale limits based on death_rate (across all years)
  overall_scale_limits <- range(df$death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Create the plot
  p <- ggplot(data = map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate)) +
    geom_polygon(color = "black", size = 0.1) +
    coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "darkred", na.value = "yellow", 
                        name = "Death Rate per 100,000", limits = overall_scale_limits) +
    ggtitle(paste("US Opioid-Use Related Death Rate - Year", current_year)) +
    labs(subtitle = "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major gridlines
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"))
  
  # Define the filepath for saving the image in the "figures" directory
  filepath <- file.path(figures, paste("opioid_death_map_", current_year, ".png", sep = ""))
  
  # Save the plot as an image in the "figures" directory
  ggsave(filename = filepath, plot = p)
}

# Generate and save maps for each year from 1990 to 2019
lapply(1990:2019, generate_and_save_map)
```

# Making a gif

Using the images created previously, I used the magick package to knit them together into a gif, this was then saved as an output and loaded onto the rmarkdown document

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Install and load the magick package
library(magick)


figures_directory <- "figures"

# Get the list of PNG files in the "figures" directory
file_names <- list.files(path = figures_directory, pattern = "\\.png$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read the PNG files into R as magick images
images <- image_read(file_names)

# Create the animation with a frame rate of 24 frames per second
animation <- image_animate(images, fps = 2)

# Specify the output format as GIF when writing the animation
animation_file <- "output.gif"
image_write(animation, animation_file, format = "gif")
```

![](output.gif)

# Making an Interactive Map

Finally I wanted the visualisation to have the interactive element of changing the year automatically. However, this just functioned as a slowed down adjustable gif

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#making maps that change by year and you can look at inidividual death rate for each state

library(shiny)
library(sass)
library(shinyWidgets)


overall_scale_limits <- range(df$death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)

map_changing <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("US Opioid-Use Related Death Rate"),
  
  # Create a slider input for selecting the year
  sliderTextInput("year", "Select Year:",
                  choices = as.character(1990:2019), selected = "1990"),
  
  # Display the plot
  plotOutput("map")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  # Generate the plot based on the selected year
  output$map <- renderPlot({
    current_data <- df %>% filter(year == input$year)
    map_data <- left_join(current_data, us_states, by = "state")
    
    ggplot(data = map_data,
           aes(x = long, y = lat,
               group = group, fill = death_rate)) +
      geom_polygon(color = "black", size = 0.1) +
      coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
      scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "darkred", na.value = "yellow", 
                          name = "Death Rate", limits = overall_scale_limits) +
      ggtitle(paste("US Opioid-Use Related Death Rate - Year", input$year)) +
      labs(subtitle = "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation") +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),
            panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
            panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"))
  })
}

shinyApp(map_changing, server)

```

# Final Visualisation

To rectify the previous issues with the plot, I combined the shiny and plotly packages to make an interactive map where there is a hover function to look at the specific death rate and state whilst having the ability to adjust the year.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Combine shiny and plotly to make an interactive map where you can hover over the states to see a value and also go through year by year
